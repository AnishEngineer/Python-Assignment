        "Ans:- In Python, mutability refers to the ability of an object to change its state or value after it's created.\n",

        "Mutable objects are those that can be modified after creation. Examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Lists: [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "2. Dictionaries: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",

        "#6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-  In Python, lists and tuples are both data structures that can store multiple values. However, they have different design goals and use cases, which is why lists are mutable and tuples are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists:\n",
        "1. Designed for modification: Lists are designed to be modified frequently. They provide methods like append, insert, remove, and sort to make it easy to add, remove, or change elements.\n",
        "2. Dynamic size: Lists can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.\n",
        "3. Use cases: Lists are suitable for situations where data needs to be modified frequently, such as:\n",
        "    - User input validation and processing\n",
        "    - Data filtering and sorting\n",
        "    - Algorithm implementation (e.g., sorting, searching)\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples:\n",
        "1. Designed for immutability: Tuples are designed to be immutable, meaning their contents cannot be modified after creation.\n",
        "2. Fixed size: Tuples have a fixed size, which is determined at creation time.\n",
        "3. Use cases: Tuples are suitable for situations where data is constant or rarely changes, such as:\n",
        "    - Representing a record or a row in a database\n",
        "    - Storing a collection of constants\n",
        "    - Returning multiple values from a function\n",
        "\n",
        "Reasons for immutability:\n",
        "1. Thread safety: Immutable data structures like tuples are inherently thread-safe, as multiple threads cannot modify the same tuple simultaneously.\n",
        "2. Code simplicity: Immutable data structures simplify code, as developers don't need to worry about unintended modifications.\n",
        "3. Performance: Immutable data structures can be optimized for performance, as the lack of modification eliminates the need for locking mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reasons for mutability:\n",
        "1. Flexibility: Mutable data structures like lists provide flexibility, allowing developers to modify data as needed.\n",
        "2. Efficiency: Mutable data structures can be more efficient, as modifications can be made in-place without creating new copies.\n",

        "\n",
        "Equality Operator (==):\n",
        "1. Checks for equality: == checks if the values of two objects are equal.\n",
        "2. Compares contents: When comparing complex data structures like lists, dictionaries, or objects, == compares their contents.\n",
        "3. Returns True or False: The result of the comparison is a boolean value (True or False).\n",
        "\n",
        "Identity Operator (is):\n",
        "1. Checks for identity: is checks if two objects are the same instance, i.e., they have the same memory address.\n",
        "2. Compares memory addresses: When comparing objects, is checks if they point to the same memory location.\n",
        "3. Returns True or False: The result of the comparison is a boolean value (True or False).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key differences:\n",
        "1. Value vs. Identity: == checks for equality of values, while is checks for identity (same instance).\n",
        "2. Complex data structures: When comparing complex data structures, == compares contents, while is compares memory addresses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "Types of Logical Operators:\n",
        "1. And (and): Returns True if both conditions are True.\n",

        "3. Not (not): Returns the opposite of the condition (i.e., True becomes False and vice versa).\n",
